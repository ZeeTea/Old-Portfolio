                <p>The coast is known for a multitude of things from its history to the beach. Mississippi is all that talked about, but our coast is
                    known. On the coast, we have so many events from: concerts, casinos, and our cruisin' the coast. Cruisin' the coast is an event where you
                    can see all different types of cars from old, new, and/or moded cars that drive up and down our beaches. Our concerts bring in most people because of
                    the big name celebrities such as Kings of Comedy, Dark Veil Brides, and more that was just recently held here and then our cosinos also hold events as well.
                    Casinos are a big part of our coastal city we have 12 that are open 24/7, but if you don't like the casino light we also have fun things to do on the side as well.
